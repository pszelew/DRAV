# VAE + Bert-like model for language representation for low-resource language understanding

## Motivation

1) Questions based on https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/Optimus (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04092)
  - Do we really need GPT2 part for language representation tasks?
  - Does sophisticated VAE implementations improve quality of a solution?
  - How does the model scale with amount of data
  - Does using VAE acctually improve the solution? If so in what cases

2) Language modeling using Transformers if we don't have a lot of data (problem of job applications written in polish)
